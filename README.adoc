= Demo TestTemplate & InvocationInterceptor

This demonstrates how to use a JUnit 5 `TestTemplate` in combination with a `InvocationInterceptor` to access the generated parameter.

== Description

We have integration tests that should behave exactly the same, while different providers provide some service to our system under test.
We don't want to duplicate the tests, but use `TestTemplate` tests instead, which the `AccountFixture` provides the values for.

Now, some providers don't yet support some use-cases, so we disable the corresponding tests with a `@NotYetProvidedBy` annotation.
But we still want to see those tests marked as skipped, so we know which providers still need to do what.
